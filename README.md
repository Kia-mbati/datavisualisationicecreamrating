# 🍦 Ice Cream Ratings – Data Visualization Project

## 🔍 Overview
This project explores customer ratings for various ice cream flavors using Python-based data visualization. The goal was to uncover trends and preferences in ice cream consumption through clear, engaging visual storytelling.

## ⚒️ Tools & Libraries Used
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

## 🧩 Problem Statement
Understanding what factors influence ice cream ratings can help manufacturers and retailers optimize flavor offerings and marketing efforts. This project visualizes those insights from a structured dataset.

## 🔧 What I Did
- Loaded and explored the dataset using Pandas  
- Performed data cleaning and preparation  
- Created visualizations to analyze:
  - Average ratings per flavor
  - Ratings by age group or gender (if applicable)
  - Correlation between variables (e.g., price vs. rating)  
- Customized charts for visual clarity and storytelling

## 📈 Key Visuals & Insights
- Bar charts of top-rated flavors  
- Heatmaps showing rating correlations  
- Distribution plots revealing consumer preferences  
- Comparative plots (boxplots, strip plots, etc.)

> *Visualizations help identify standout flavors and the demographic trends behind them.*

## 🎯 Outcome
This project demonstrates how data visualization can simplify and reveal insights in consumer behavior. It highlights:
- Analytical thinking  
- Python data visualization skills  
- Ability to communicate data-driven stories clearly
